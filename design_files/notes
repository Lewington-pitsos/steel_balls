process for State Manager:

1. check if the state has already been exhaustively scored. If so, go ahead and just return that score.
2. if the state has been scored but not exhaustively
  1. grab the current score and all the recorded information we have on the selections for this state.
  2. pick the best [ whatever breadth we're using ] rated but un-scored selections (and of course any associated states), and work out scores for them.
  3. check if the state score generated using those selections is LESS THAN the current score
    1. if so, save the new score and return it
    2. otherwise, just return the old score
3. if the state has not been scored at all, start the normal process (state evaluator)
